# Introduction and Logistics

## Aim of this course

This course will provide you with an introduction to the functioning of modern deep learning systems.

We will build (from scratch) needle, a deep learning library loosely similar to PyTorch.

## Why should you take this course

### Reason #1: To build deep learning systems

### Reason #2: To use existing systems more effectively

### Reason #3: Deep learning systems are fun

Despite the seeming complexity, the core underlying algorithms behind deep learning systems are extermely simple.

Automatic differentiation + gradient-based optimization.
